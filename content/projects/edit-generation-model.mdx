A deep learning-based image editing tool that learns user editing preferences from raw/edited image pairs and automatically applies those preferences to new images using Pix2Pix (conditional GAN) architecture.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Style Learning**: Trains on your raw/edited image pairs to learn your editing preferences
- **Pattern-Based Matching**: Automatically matches raw and edited images using prefix/suffix patterns
- **GPU Acceleration**: Supports MPS (Apple Silicon), CUDA (NVIDIA), and CPU
- **Flexible Input Formats**: Supports various image formats for raw images (JPG, PNG, TIFF, RAW, etc.)
- **Standardized Output**: Generates edited images in JPG or PNG format

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **Pix2Pix**: Conditional GAN architecture for image-to-image translation
- **U-Net Generator**: Encoder-decoder structure with skip connections
- **PatchGAN Discriminator**: Classifies 70x70 image patches
- **Computer Vision**: Image processing and transformation

## Model Architecture

The model uses a **Pix2Pix** architecture:

- **Generator**: U-Net with encoder-decoder structure and skip connections
- **Discriminator**: PatchGAN that classifies 70x70 image patches
- **Loss Function**: Combination of L1 loss (pixel-wise) and adversarial loss

## Project Highlights

- **Style Transfer**: Learns individual editing styles from training data
- **Automatic Pairing**: Intelligent pattern matching for raw/edited image pairs
- **Cross-Platform GPU Support**: Works with Apple Silicon (MPS), NVIDIA (CUDA), and CPU
- **Flexible Training**: Configurable epochs, batch size, learning rate, and image size
- **Production Ready**: Complete training and inference pipeline

## Usage Workflow

1. **Prepare Training Data**: Place raw/edited image pairs in structured directories
2. **Train Model**: Train on image pairs to learn editing style
3. **Run Inference**: Apply learned style to new raw images automatically

## Technical Details

- **Image Pair Matching**: Supports prefix, suffix, and exact match patterns
- **Training Options**: Configurable epochs, batch size, learning rate, L1 loss weight
- **Memory Efficient**: Supports batch processing and variable image sizes
- **Checkpoint System**: Saves model checkpoints at regular intervals

This project demonstrates expertise in deep learning, computer vision, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and building production-ready machine learning pipelines for image processing applications.
