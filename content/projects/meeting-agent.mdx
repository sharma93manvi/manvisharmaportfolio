A Chrome Extension that listens to your meetings, transcribes them in real-time, and generates summaries with follow-up tasks. Built with Chrome Extension Manifest V3, Python FastAPI backend, and Web Speech API.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Transcription**: Captures audio from active browser tabs and transcribes meetings in real-time using Web Speech API
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Generates intelligent summaries of meeting content with key points and insights
- **Task Detection**: Automatically identifies and extracts follow-up tasks from meeting transcripts
- **Meeting History**: Stores meeting transcripts and summaries locally using Chrome storage
- **Audio Capture**: Uses `chrome.tabCapture` API to capture audio streams directly from browser tabs
- **Offscreen Document**: Implements offscreen document for continuous speech recognition

## Technologies Used

- **Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)**: Latest web extension standard for security and performance
- **Python FastAPI**: Backend server handling business logic, AI processing, and summarization
- **Web Speech API**: Built-in browser API for real-time speech-to-text transcription
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for extension functionality
- **Chrome APIs**: 
  - `chrome.tabCapture` for audio capture
  - `chrome.storage.local` for local data persistence
- **HTML/CSS**: Lightweight UI implementation with modern CSS variables

## Project Highlights

- **Real-time Processing**: Continuous audio capture and transcription during meetings
- **AI Summarization**: Dynamic processing in Python backend for intelligent meeting summaries
- **Task Extraction**: Automatically identifies actionable items from meeting transcripts
- **Privacy-First**: Local storage and processing with optional cloud summarization
- **Cross-Platform**: Works with any web-based meeting platform (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, etc.)
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Clean interface for viewing meeting history and summaries

## Implementation Details

- **Manifest V3**: Uses the latest Chrome Extension standard
- **Background Scripts**: Handles audio capture and extension lifecycle
- **Offscreen Document**: Enables continuous speech recognition
- **FastAPI Backend**: Python server for AI-powered summarization
- **Local Storage**: Chrome storage API for meeting history persistence

This project demonstrates expertise in browser extension development, real-time audio processing, AI integration, and building productivity tools that enhance meeting workflows.
