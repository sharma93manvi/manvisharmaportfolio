A collection of exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects on different datasets. Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook, a short write-up of questions explored, and links to data sources.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Datasets**: Analysis of various datasets to understand different data patterns
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis with code, visualizations, and insights
- **Documentation**: Clear write-ups explaining the questions explored and findings
- **Data Sources**: Links to original datasets for reproducibility

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive development environment
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing

## Project Structure

Each analysis includes:
- Exploratory data analysis notebook
- Summary of key findings
- Data source references
- Visualization outputs

This project demonstrates my ability to conduct thorough exploratory data analysis, identify patterns in data, and communicate findings effectively through visualizations and documentation.
